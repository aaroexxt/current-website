Doing robotics all four years of highschool was a memorable, rewarding experience that taught me a number of skills: leadership, perserverance, hard work, and engineering, among many other soft skills that come with working with a team of students to design and build a robot that could be used to complete a variety of tasks.

# Introduction

By way of background, I've included some snippets from the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIRST_Robotics_Competition):

`The FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) is an international high school robotics competition. Each year, teams of high school students, coaches, and mentors work during a six-week period to build robots capable of competing in that year's game that weigh up to 125 pounds (57 kg). Robots complete tasks such as scoring balls into goals, placing inner tubes onto racks, hanging on bars, and balancing robots on balance beams. The game, along with the required set of tasks, changes annually. While teams are given a kit of standard set of parts during the annual Kickoff, they are also allowed and are encouraged to buy or make specialized parts.`

`FIRST Robotics Competition has a unique culture that is built around two values. "Gracious Professionalism" embraces the competition inherent in the program, but rejects trash talk and chest-thumping, instead embracing empathy and respect for other teams. "Coopertition" emphasizes that teams can cooperate and compete at the same time. The goal of the program is to inspire students to be science and technology leaders.`

My school's teams, the Iron Panthers (FRC #5026 and FTC #7316), competed in both

## FTC Robotics

My freshman and sophomore years of highschool were spent working on our school's First Tech Challenge (FTC) robot, which was a smaller and less advanced version of the FRC (First Robotics Challenge) robot.

The Iron Panther's motto is "Student Led, Student Run", which came through in everything that we did. From the begininning of the design process, which was ideation, we worked with mentors to advise us but did all of the design work ourselves.

I was elected to be the driver of the robot my freshman year, which meant I was responsible for driving it in competitions against other schools, which are scored on a point-based system. Competition, when we traveled to other schools to compete for points, was always an exciting affair

Another big part of our team is

## FRC Robotics

My junior and senior years, I worked primarily on the FRC team, tasked with building a much larger robot which was also capable of doing more advanced tasks. We worked much the same as FTC, except that we were on a more constrained timeline: 6 weeks instead of FTC's multiple months until the first competition.

Our general process consisted of:

- Ideation, in which we would come up with a number of prototype ideas
- Scoring, in which we would score them using a Fibonacci scale for difficulty vs benefit
- Prototyping, in which we would create a number of different prototypes and continue to refine them in small teams
- Final design, and machining of the competition robot
- Continued tweaks during the season as we learned more about the success in competition

In the prototyping phase, we often built simple wooden designs to test core ideas:

Then moved up to more advanced designs once the prototype was proven:

I was elected to engineering captain

## COVID

Although the last two seasons were cut off due to the COVID pandemic after our 2019 victory, work did not stop altogether with the robot.

Although denied access to the shop, we continued to work in team member's garages, and we were able to complete a few tasks on our robot.

# Conclusion

Overall, I'm extremely proud of my four seasons as an Iron Panther and feel so lucky to have been part of such a talented team of students, mentors, and of course our coach Ms. Wade! Our team's motto "Student Built, Student Run" really shone through during my time on the team, and the experience gave me the fundamental skills to be a leader and a team player, not to mention learning the process of engineering, design, and fabrication.
