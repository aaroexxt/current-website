# MIT 2.671 - RTK GPS Characterization

As part of the Mechanical Engineering curriculum at MIT, one core class is called 2.671 - Measurement and Instrumentation.
One major aim of the class is to develop experience writing clear, concise, and convincing scientific papers that performs an experiment of your choice. In the process, we set up a quantifable experiment that can be performed within a single semester. This project is called **Go Forth and Measure**.

For my project, I chose to quantify the accuracy of GPS, specifically augmented with RTK corrections over a RTCM channel (a local correction station). As the paper explains, RTK GPS is relevant in many industries today, from aviation and aerospace to cellphones and navigation.
