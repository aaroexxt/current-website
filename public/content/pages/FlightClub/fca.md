# Flight Club

In 2020, I joined Flight Club because I was fascinated by the challenge of building a human-pilotable ultralight plane with fellow students. I was elected Avionics Lead, responsible for training electrical and software teams. My focus is on critical systems, including battery management, sensor fusion, and pilot display hardware and software.
