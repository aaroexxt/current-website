# Flight Club

In 2020, I joined Flight Club because I was fascinated by the challenge of building a human-pilotable ultralight plane with fellow students.

During my time on the team, I was elected to Electrical/Avionics lead. In that position, I primarily planned lessons among other things, which included planning an architecture for readout software for the plane as well as avionics layouts (working with others).

Pictured below is one of the layouts for the web-based plane interface:

I also created content to teach PCB design to students who were joining the team in Eagle PCB, by Autodesk. This helped grow the number of members who were also skilled in electrical design by a significant amount.

Below is a sample lesson I gave for people to complete at home, due to the pandemic.

# Conclusion

Being a part of Flight Club was a great experience and chance to bond with my peers over the shared love of aviation, electronics, and flight. In the future, I'm excited to take part in more student-led activities, like MIT's FSAE and Rocket Teams to continue building my skills while working with others!
